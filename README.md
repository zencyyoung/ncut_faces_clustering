# ncut_faces_clustering
This is the project to normalized cut the two different people,the dataset is the .mat format, it's also have .jpg to visulize.
The datasets contain 20 people's faces.
Calculating  the euclidean distance between the images, then use the kernal function exp(-d/std) output the similarity matrix .
You can run the .ipynb, it would be easy to read the function needed

## codes
This project contains three files

normcut.py

normcut.ipynb
	
python_ncut_lib.py

## run

I provide two ways to run the code.

	$jupyter notebook

and then run all, it's easy for you to understand all the media function you need.

another way is use python
